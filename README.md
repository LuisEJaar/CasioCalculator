    # Calculator Project
This project had the goal of recreating the form and functionality of an old casio calculator. Feel free to play around and I hope you enjoy the nostalgia. It was really fun incorporating the on / off and memory buttons. Its interesting how these sort of ate numbers in certain scenarios and that was non-intuitive but fun to add.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
The buttons use event listeners to perform given tasks and the construction is mainly non OOP with the exception of where any given information is stored. 

## Optimizations
- Support keyboard functionality
- Saving of memory values in localStorage 

## Lessons Learned:

I certainly would have incorporated more objects had I known about them at the time of initially creating the project and there were a few occasions where I could have practiced using case statements instead of multiple else if chains.
